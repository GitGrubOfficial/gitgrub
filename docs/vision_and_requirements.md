# GitGrub Vision and Requirements Document

## Vision Statement

GitGrub is a social recipe management platform that brings the power of
version control to cooking. By applying software development principles
to recipe creation and sharing, GitGrub enables home cooks, professional
chefs, and food enthusiasts to track recipe evolution, collaborate on
improvements, and build upon each other's culinary innovations. Our
platform makes recipe iteration visible, traceable, and social.

## Problem Statement

Current recipe management solutions face several limitations:
- No structured way to track recipe changes over time
- Difficulty collaborating on recipe improvements
- No clear lineage of how recipes evolve and branch into variants
- Limited ability to merge improvements back into original recipes
- Social sharing focuses on final products rather than the creative
  process

GitGrub addresses these gaps by bringing version control concepts from
software development into cooking, creating a dynamic ecosystem for
culinary creation and collaboration.

## Target Users

1. **Home Cooking Enthusiasts**
   - Want to refine personal recipes over time
   - Need to document variations that worked/didn't work

2. **Professional Chefs**
   - Need to standardize recipes across teams
   - Want to iterate on recipes systematically

3. **Recipe Developers**
   - Need to track changes throughout testing phases
   - Want to collaborate with others on recipe creation

4. **Food Bloggers**
   - Want to share recipe development process
   - Need to manage multiple versions for different audiences

## Core Features

### Version Control System

- Recipe "commits" with change documentation
- Visual diff viewing between versions
- Recipe history timeline
- Branching for variations and experiments
- Ability to merge improvements back to main recipes

### Recipe Management

- Standardized recipe structure (ingredients, quantities, steps,
  metadata)
- Tags and categorization
- Search and filtering
- Import from external sources with automatic structuring

### Social Features

- User profiles with cooking style/preferences
- Following/follower system
- Activity feed of recipe changes and new creations
- Recipe "forking" with attribution
- Comments and suggestions on specific recipe elements

### Collaboration Tools

- Recipe "pull requests" for suggested improvements
- Collaborative editing functionality
- Permission levels for recipes (private, friends-only, public)
- Recipe review and approval workflows

## Technical Requirements for GitGrub MVP

### Authentication & Security

- User authentication via email/password and optional OAuth (Google,
  Facebook)
- Basic role-based authorization (owner, contributor, viewer)
- Secure password storage and handling
- User profile management functionality

### Version Control Core

- Database schema supporting recipe versions with timestamps
- "Commit" functionality for recipe changes with required change notes
- Simple visual diff between any two versions of a recipe
- Basic branching capability for recipe variations
- Recipe fork functionality with attribution tracking

### Recipe Data Structure

- Standardized recipe model (ingredients with quantities/units, steps,
  metadata)
- Support for basic recipe metadata (prep time, cook time, servings,
  tags)
- Image upload for primary recipe photo
- Validation for required recipe fields

### API Design

- RESTful API endpoints for all core functionality
- API documentation
- Authentication tokens for API access
- Rate limiting for basic protection

### Frontend Requirements

- Responsive web design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Recipe editor with structured fields
- Version history viewer
- Basic search and filtering
- Intuitive UI for viewing recipe "diffs"

### Infrastructure

- Deployment environment (cloud provider)
- CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment
- Database backup strategy
- Logging system for errors and user actions
- Basic monitoring for system health

### Data Import/Export

- JSON export of individual recipes with version history
- Basic import functionality for standard recipe formats
- Bulk export of user's recipe collection

### Performance

- Initial load performance targets (<3s for recipe page)
- Database query optimization for version history
- Image optimization for uploads

## MVP Feature Prioritization

Features are prioritized into three tiers:
- **P0 (Critical)**: Must-have features for initial MVP launch
- **P1 (High Priority)**: Important features that significantly enhance
  the core experience
- **P2 (Medium Priority)**: Valuable features that could be implemented
  post-initial launch

### P0 - Critical Features (Must Have)

**Recipe & Version Control:**
- Basic recipe CRUD operations
- Simple version history with timestamps
- Ability to view and compare any two versions
- Required change notes for each version

**User Management:**
- User registration and authentication (email/password)
- Basic user profiles
- Public/private recipe visibility settings

**Core User Experience:**
- Recipe editor with structured fields for ingredients and steps
- Recipe detail view with version history access
- Basic recipe search by name and tags
- Mobile-responsive design for core screens

**Infrastructure:**
- Secure database with backup strategy
- Basic error logging
- Production deployment environment

### P1 - High Priority Features

**Version Control Enhancements:**
- Recipe forking with attribution tracking
- Basic branching for variations
- Visual diff highlighting for ingredients and steps

**Social Features:**
- Follow/unfollow functionality
- Basic activity feed of followed users
- Simple commenting on recipes

**Data Management:**
- JSON export of individual recipes
- Basic image upload for recipe photos
- Tags and categorization system

**Infrastructure:**
- OAuth integration (Google, Facebook)
- API documentation
- Basic monitoring

### P2 - Medium Priority Features

**Advanced Collaboration:**
- Recipe "pull requests" for suggested improvements
- Collaborative editing functionality
- Role-based permissions (owner, contributor, viewer)

**Enhanced Import/Export:**
- Import from external recipe sources
- Bulk export functionality
- Advanced recipe metadata support

**Performance & Experience:**
- Advanced search and filtering
- Performance optimization for version history
- Enhanced UI for viewing recipe "diffs"
- CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment

## Constraints

- Need to balance technical version control concepts with user-friendly
  interfaces
- Recipe structure standardization vs. flexibility for different cuisine
  types
- Private recipe storage limits and premium tier considerations
- Intellectual property considerations for shared recipes
