# GitGrub - Backlog Organization and Development Roadmap

## 1. Executive Summary

This document organizes the product backlog for GitGrub, a version-controlled recipe management application. It categorizes existing user stories, adds some foundational planning and DevOps work , and establishes a roadmap for MVP development.

## 2. Current State Assessment

GitGrub is currently in Proof of Concept (POC) stage with basic functionality for:

- Recipe creation, viewing, and editing
- Version history tracking
- Recipe forking
- Markdown-based recipe storage

The application uses a Git-based backend to handle versioning and forking, with Express.js serving as the API layer and React for the frontend.

## 3. Architectural Overview

The planned architecture for GitGrub is illustrated below:

    end

    class nginx,backend,frontend container;
    class git_repos,pg_data volume;
    class postgres db;
    class users,recipes,versions,forks schema;
```

This architecture focuses on a self-hosted solution rather than cloud deployment, using Docker containers to provide a consistent environment. The initial deployment will be on a local server.

## 4. Data Schema Evolution

Part of the development will be evolving the data structure from the current markdown-based storage to a more structured JSON format that will better support advanced features.

### Current Data Structure

- Recipes stored as markdown files in Git repositories
- Simple text-based format easy for initial development
- Limited structure for advanced features like ingredient scaling

### Target Data Structure for MVP

- JSON-based recipe format with structured fields
- PostgreSQL for user data and authentication
- Git repositories remain the source of truth for all recipe content
- Schema designed to support:
  - Precise ingredient quantity scaling
  - Unit conversion
  - Basic categorization and tagging

### Schema Requirements

- User schema in PostgreSQL (authentication, preferences, permissions)
- Recipe content as structured JSON in Git repositories (for versioning)
- No recipe metadata in PostgreSQL for MVP (will be added later as traffic grows)
- Git repositories will remain the source of truth for recipes

## 5. MVP Definition

## 8. Technical Architecture Refinements

Based on the current POC, The following architectural refinements are recommended:

### Database & Storage

- Set up PostgreSQL for user data only
- Define schema for structured recipe data in JSON format
- Update Git repository structure to accommodate JSON format

### Backend

- Enhance Node.js API to work with PostgreSQL for users and Git storage for recipes
- Add proper user authentication with OAuth
- Update recipe handling to support structured ingredients and scaling
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Implement input validation and sanitization

### Frontend

- Add state management solution (Redux, Context API)
- Create UI components for structured recipe entry
- Implement form validation
- Add responsive design for mobile
- Implement lazy loading for performance
- Add proper error handling and user feedback
- Develop with internationalization in mind

### DevOps

- Enhance Docker configuration for local development and production
- Set up basic monitoring for the local server
- Implement automated backups for Git repositories
- Configure Nginx reverse proxy for production

## 9. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Self-hosted solution may face reliability or security challenges | High | Medium | Implement proper monitoring, backups, and security practices; document recovery procedures |
| Git-based storage may face performance issues as recipe collection grows | Medium | Medium | Implement caching strategies and optimize query patterns; plan for potential future database integration for recipe metadata |
| Authentication system complexity may delay development | Medium | Medium | Start with simple email/password, then add social logins incrementally |
| Free-time development may lead to inconsistent progress | Medium | High | Break work into small, self-contained tasks; establish clear documentation standards; hold regular check-ins |
| Initial content creation (100 recipes) may be resource-intensive | Medium | High | Begin collection early, consider outsourcing or using public domain recipes with attribution |

## 10. Next Steps

1. Finalize user schema design for PostgreSQL
2. Design JSON structure for recipe content
3. Develop prototype for converting markdown recipes to JSON format
4. Enhance Docker configuration for development environment
5. Begin implementing user authentication with PostgreSQL
